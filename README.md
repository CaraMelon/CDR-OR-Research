linear optimization.ipynb is the jupyter notebook for the linear optimization model that produces the item scores.

model and analysis.ipynb is the jupyter notebook that produced the averaged item scores from historical data by averaging the results of calling linear optimization.ipynb. It also contains the code for the decision support analysis discussed in Section 6.

validation with benchmark.ipynb is the code used to validate our model with our random benchmark data. The notebook also generates the random benchmark data sets.

final item score.csv stores the final item scores output by the model

benchmark dataset.csv stores all the benchmark data
